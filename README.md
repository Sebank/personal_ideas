The intention of this repository is both for a personal outlet, where I can pursue projects of interest, and a window into my coding habits. 

The initial goal is to have smaller projects in different languages to show general profficiency in languages and programming techniques. 

- statistical analysis - R
	We want to fit a regularized GLM on a dataset with missing data for inference. 

- machine learning - python
	Keras neural net on sentimental analysis? (or prediction on russian house market?)

- sudoku solver - C++
	Object oriented recursion (CSP)

- pointers (alt. massively parallel problem CUDA, pthreads, MPI?) - C

- Another class problem (maybe adding child to a system adds parents by reference) - Java

The mid goal is to learn and do a project in a language I am not proficient in (C#, .NET). 

- Self initiated project (maybe hotkeys?) - C#

The final goal is a larger full stack project (no ambition of achieving this yet). 

- Need to brainstorm when closer, both language and objective



Potential alternatives
	- take list of priorities (match one with one) and return optimal distribution (class recursion)
	- Pacman, with increasing difficulty AI (random at each intersection, random but if close chase, chase, IMPOSSIBLE: all ghost coordinate and flank the player)
